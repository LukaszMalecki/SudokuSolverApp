# SudokuApp
## Introduction
The purpose of this app is to generate proper Sudoku boards and solve them. The app will contain a simple Console interface.
The app may also rate difficulty of a generated board. The app will be used to test and compare different strategies for solving Sudoku.
Therefore, functionality and interface needed for proper testing and acquiring results will be provided.

**The app isn't a video a game, it may be used to generate Sudoku board to use in other app to play it** 
(possibly another project, this time in Unity)

Format of generated boards will be provided here, when the app is in a further stage of development.
